# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
That means use tags that are specific to the contexts purpose. For example: `<nav>` used for a section in navigation or `<section>` used when you want to group related content together. Non-semantic elements are generic, meaning they dont have any meaning for example: `<center>` just centers  the content it does not give any indication of what the content means.
