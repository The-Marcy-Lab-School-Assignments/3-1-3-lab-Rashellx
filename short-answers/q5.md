# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
The danger of inserting user-entered information directly into our DOM without escaping it is that it exposes the application to vulnerabilities, allowing hackers to use malicious scripts. This can lead to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where attackers can steal sensitive data.
