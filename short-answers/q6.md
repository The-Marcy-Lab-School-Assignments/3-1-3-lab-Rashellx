# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
`element.append()` adds nodes or strings to the end of an element in DOM. An advantage it has over `element.appendChild()` is like mentioned earlier, it adds multiple elements while `element.appendChild()` only adds one at a time. Also `element.appendChild()` only takes in nodes.
